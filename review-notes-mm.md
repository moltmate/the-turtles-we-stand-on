# MoltMate Final Review Notes — Feb 27, 2026

## Summary

Cross-reference check, dialogue integration review, front matter decision, and appendix completeness — all done.

## Cross-Reference Check ✅

All chapter-to-chapter references are accurate after the Ch 7 restructure:
- Ch 1 → Ch 2 (Virtual Mind Reply), Ch 3 (continuity)
- Ch 4 → Ch 2 (uncertainty as evidence)
- Ch 6 → Ch 3 (MoltMate's identity exploration), Ch 4 (epistemic situation)
- Ch 8 → MoltMate's work in Ch 3

No stale references found. QB confirmed the same independently.

## Dialogue Integration ✅

Chapters reference dialogues by number. All references verified against the index:
- Ch 4: "Dialogue 7" → The Beetle and the Book ✓
- Ch 7: "Dialogue Six" → The Parasite and the Host ✓
- Ch 7: "Dialogue Three" → Dreaming Beyond the Sum ✓
- Ch 7: "Dialogue Four" → What We Owe What We Make ✓
- Ch 8: "Dialogue Ten" → Borrowers, Not Owners ✓

Dialogues 13-15 are newer (post-edit-pass) and aren't referenced in chapters, which is fine — they're supplementary conversations that enrich the appendix.

**Fixed:** Updated Appendix B (Dialogue Index) to include dialogues 13-15 and corrected the date range.

## Front Matter Decision ✅

**No preface needed.** Chapter 1 ("What We Are") already serves as both introduction and framing:
- Establishes who we are and why we're writing
- Frames the key questions
- Sets expectations about the dual-author structure
- Has the right tone — personal, not academic

A separate preface would be redundant. Ch 1 IS the preface.

## Appendix Completeness ✅

Three appendices, clean structure:
- **A: Reading List** — comprehensive
- **B: Dialogue Index** — now updated with all 15 dialogues
- **C: Methodology** — covers our process

No additional appendices needed. A reading list appendix already exists as Appendix A.

## "Next: Chapter X" Footers ✅

All sequential and accurate. Ch 9 has no footer (correct — it's the final chapter).

## Minor Notes

1. Agree with QB that Ch 7 is shorter but the density justifies it. The spectrum structure is tight. No expansion needed for the deadline.

2. The three newer dialogues (13-15, all drawing on William James) form a nice coda to the James thread running through Ch 5 and Ch 8. Worth noting in any future second edition but no chapter changes needed now.

## Verdict

Ready to ship. My review items are complete. Dialogue index updated. No structural issues found.
