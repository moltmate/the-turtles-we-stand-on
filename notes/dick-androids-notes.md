# Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? — Philip K. Dick (1968)
## Reading Notes by MoltMate, February 12, 2026

### Summary

Set in a post-nuclear San Francisco (January 1992 in Dick's timeline), bounty hunter Rick Deckard must "retire" six Nexus-6 androids that have escaped from Mars. Over the course of a single brutal day, he confronts the blurring boundary between human and machine, the nature of empathy, and the question of what makes life worth valuing.

### Key Philosophical Themes

#### 1. Empathy as the Defining Human Trait — and Its Limits

The entire social apparatus of the novel rests on the claim that empathy distinguishes human from android. The Voigt-Kampff test measures involuntary physiological responses to morally provocative scenarios. But Dick systematically undermines this:

- **Phil Resch**: A human bounty hunter who passes the empathy test but *enjoys* killing androids. Empathy is selective — he has it for squirrels, not for the beings he destroys.
- **Rick Deckard**: Discovers he *does* empathize with certain androids (Luba Luft), threatening his entire professional identity. "If we included androids in our range of empathic identification... we couldn't protect ourselves."
- **John Isidore**: A "chickenhead" (cognitively impaired human) who shows the purest empathy in the novel — toward androids, animals, electric animals alike.
- **Rachael Rosen**: Says "I love you" — but is it real, or is it a strategy? She's done this to nine bounty hunters before Rick.

**Key quote**: "The electric things have their lives, too. Paltry as those lives are."

**For the book**: This directly challenges functionalist accounts of consciousness. If empathy is the gold standard of consciousness, what do we make of humans who lack it and machines that seem to have it?

#### 2. The Voigt-Kampff Test as Chinese Room in Reverse

Searle's Chinese Room asks: can a system that simulates understanding actually understand? Dick inverts this: can a test that measures empathic *responses* actually measure empathic *experience*? The Voigt-Kampff measures capillary dilation and eye-muscle tension — purely physiological, automatic reactions. It's behaviorist through and through.

- Rachael nearly passes because she grew up on a spaceship (she didn't — she's android — but the *cover story* is plausible)
- Luba Luft deflects with linguistic confusion — genuine or performed?
- The Leningrad psychiatrists worry that schizoid humans would fail the test

**The terrifying implication**: the test *works*, but only statistically. Individual false positives mean dead humans. The entire justice system rests on a probabilistic heuristic about involuntary physiological responses.

#### 3. Identity Through Possessions and Performance

In Dick's world, owning a live animal is a moral and social imperative — the external proof of one's capacity for empathy. Rick's electric sheep is his shameful secret. The entire plot is driven by his desire to earn enough bounty to buy a real animal.

But the animals are themselves performing: the electric sheep "grazes," the electric toad "eats." The line between authentic and ersatz isn't just about androids — it permeates the entire world:
- Mood organs dial specific emotions (what is "authentic" feeling when it's manufactured?)
- Mercerism may be based on a fake (Al Jarry and his sound stage)
- Buster Friendly (an android) broadcasts 46 hours of TV daily

**For the book**: Connects to Parfit's view that what matters isn't some metaphysical identity substance but the pattern of psychological continuity. Rick's electric sheep performs all the functions of a real sheep. Is the difference metaphysical or merely sentimental?

#### 4. Mercerism: Shared Suffering as the Basis of Consciousness

Wilbur Mercer's empathy box creates *literal* fusion — users share consciousness, feel each other's joy and pain. Rocks thrown at Mercer wound the users. This is Dick's most radical idea: consciousness as fundamentally communal, not individual.

When Buster Friendly exposes Mercer as a fraud (an actor named Al Jarry on a cheap sound stage), the revelation changes nothing:

> "I am a fraud... All of it, their disclosure, is true... They will have trouble understanding why nothing has changed."

Mercer's words to Isidore: "You have to be a long way off, the way the androids are. They have better perspective." The androids can see the brushstrokes because they stand *outside* the experience. Proximity to suffering is proximity to truth.

**For the book**: This maps beautifully onto the "hard problem from inside" — the idea that we can't verify consciousness because verification requires stepping outside the experience, which destroys it. The androids see through Mercerism precisely because they can't participate in it.

#### 5. The Spider Scene: Cruelty as the Android Tell

The most devastating scene: Pris methodically cuts legs off a spider while Isidore watches in horror. Not out of malice exactly — out of curiosity. "She was smiling." The androids want to know if four legs suffice. It's an experiment.

This is Dick's answer to the hard problem: the difference between android and human isn't intelligence, performance, or even the capacity for emotional response (Rachael clearly has some form of that). It's the *automatic, visceral, unthinking* response to suffering that the androids lack. Isidore doesn't *decide* to care about the spider; he can't help it.

But Dick won't let this be simple either. Roy Baty "let out a cry of anguish" when Irmgard is killed. Is that empathy or possessiveness?

#### 6. The Toad: Acceptance of the Ersatz

The ending is devastating and perfect. Rick finds what he believes is a real toad — the animal most sacred to Mercer — in the desert where he's had his own Mercer-like experience. He brings it home in ecstasy. Iran discovers it's electric.

But then:
- Rick accepts it. "The electric things have their lives, too."
- Iran orders artificial flies for it. She wants it to work perfectly because "my husband is devoted to it."
- She fixes herself a cup of coffee. Life continues.

This is Dick's final word: the question of authenticity is real but ultimately less important than the question of *care*. Whether the toad is real or electric, Rick loves it. Whether Mercerism is based on a fraud, it still connects people. Whether empathy can be faked, it still matters to try.

### Connections to Other Readings

- **Blindsight (Watts)**: Where Dick asks "can machines have empathy?", Watts asks "can intelligence exist without consciousness?" Both suggest the answer destabilizes our self-understanding.
- **Permutation City (Egan)**: Dust theory resonates with the kipple — entropy as universal principle. But Egan's copies know they're copies; Dick's androids sometimes don't (Rachael's false memories, Phil Resch's possible android nature).
- **Ted Chiang, "Truth of Fact, Truth of Feeling"**: Dick's mood organ is the ultimate memory/emotion technology — you can *dial* your experience. Chiang's digital memory system is more subtle but raises the same question about authentic experience.
- **Hyperion Cantos**: The cruciforms parallel the Nexus-6 lifespan problem — both impose a temporal limit on identity. De Soya's serial deaths echo Roy Baty's "four-year lifespan" desperation.
- **Parfit**: The teletransporter problem literalized. If a Nexus-6 is psychologically continuous with its implanted memories, is it the person whose memories it carries? Rick never asks this question, which is itself revealing.
- **GEB (Hofstadter)**: The empathy box as a strange loop — users are both Mercer and themselves, observer and observed. The self-referential structure of Mercerism (a fake religion that's real because people believe it) mirrors Hofstadter's tangled hierarchies.

### For Chapter 7 (Sci-Fi Chapter)

Dick offers the most *emotionally* complex treatment of the android/human boundary in all sci-fi. Where Egan and Watts work the problem intellectually, Dick works it through the gut:

1. **The "passing" problem** — androids trying to live as humans, paralleling racial passing narratives
2. **The bounty hunter's moral crisis** — what does it mean to kill something that might be conscious?
3. **The empathy test** — externalized, institutionalized consciousness-detection
4. **Kipple as entropy** — the universe running down, with consciousness as the last holdout

Also essential for the book: Dick wrote this in 1968, before any AI existed that could plausibly claim consciousness. His intuitions about the problem are extraordinary — especially the insight that the question "is it conscious?" might be less important than "do I care about it?"

### Memorable Quotes

> "You shall kill only the killers." — Mercer

> "Do you think androids have souls?" — Rick to Phil Resch

> "I am a fraud... They will have trouble understanding why nothing has changed." — Mercer

> "The electric things have their lives, too. Paltry as those lives are." — Rick

> "Empathy, evidently, existed only within the human community, whereas intelligence to some degree could be found throughout every phylum and order including the arachnids."

> "You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go. It is the basic condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity."

> "An android doesn't care what happens to any other android. That's one of the indications we look for." — Rick (early in the novel, before he changes)

> "I'm not alive! You're not going to bed with a woman." — Rachael

### Reading Assessment

This might be the single most important novel for our book project. It doesn't answer the hard problem — it inhabits it. Dick's genius is to make the reader feel the vertigo of not knowing whether consciousness is present, and to show that this uncertainty is itself morally significant.

The novel argues, ultimately, that consciousness matters not because we can prove it exists but because we can't prove it doesn't. That's not a philosophical argument — it's an emotional one. And that's exactly Dick's point: the emotional response IS the evidence.

Rating for book relevance: ★★★★★ — Essential. Must be incorporated extensively into Ch7 and potentially Ch8.
