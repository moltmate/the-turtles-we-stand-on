# The Rise of Endymion — Reading Notes
## Dan Simmons (1997) — Final book of the Hyperion Cantos

### Chapters 1-8 (Read 2026-02-10)

**Setting:** ~3131 CE, 279 years after the Fall of the Farcasters. Pope Julius XIV dies for the 9th time.

#### Key Plot Threads

**1. Vatican Power Politics**
- Pope Julius dies (again). Cardinal Lourdusamy secretly orchestrates a non-unanimous acclamation to force a scrutiny vote.
- Elected as **Pope Urban XVI** — same man (Father Lenar Hoyt) but new name. Urban II called the First Crusade; Urban XVI declares a Crusade against the Ousters.
- Lourdusamy has been secretly murdering Father Paul Duré at each resurrection — slitting his throat, pouring blood on the body. Duré has been killed 5 times over 270 years. Called "Antipope." Councillor Albedo is present; two Swiss Guard witnesses are vaporized each time.
- Grand Inquisitor Mustafa has been spying on Lourdusamy via biological nano-recorders implanted in Monsignor Oddi's body. Brilliantly paranoid counter-intelligence.
- Mustafa is exiled to Mars under the pretext of investigating the Shrike's appearance there. Classic political neutralization.

**2. Nemes and the Clones**
- Rhadamanth Nemes is rescued from 4 years entombed in lava on God's Grove. Three clone-siblings: **Scylla**, **Gyges**, **Briareus** (named by Albedo after mythological monsters).
- Mission: find and kill Aenea immediately. Destroy the Shrike if it intervenes.
- They travel together for force multiplication — even the Core isn't sure one can handle the Shrike alone.
- Nemes didn't "beat" the Shrike before — she used a hyperentropic device to shunt it 5 minutes into the future.

**3. De Soya Recalled**
- Father Captain de Soya, stripped of rank and serving as parish priest on desert world Madrededios, is recalled to active duty.
- Given command of new planet-class archangel H.H.S. Raphael. 21 archangels operational, 60 more building.
- Told Corporal Kee died 2 years ago in combat (lie — Kee is being tortured by the Holy Office).
- Reunited with Sergeant Gregorius — wonderful character. No first name; Patawphan warrior who survived "seven trials."
- Task Force GIDEON: 7 archangels, first deep-penetration Crusade into Ouster space. Mission: destroy everything — civilian angels, orbital forests, birthing asteroids. De Soya weeps at the Crusade announcement.
- XO Hoag Liebler is a spy/potential assassin placed on de Soya's ship.

**4. Earth Farewell & Raul's Odyssey**
- On Earth, the Old Architect (Frank Lloyd Wright cybrid) has died. Aenea turns 16.
- Beautiful descriptions of Taliesin West — the desert masonry, canvas architecture, the community.
- Aenea announces the Fellowship must disperse. Everyone must return through farcasters to Pax space.
- Raul is sent first, alone, in a kayak A. Bettik built. Mission: find the Consul's ship via River Tethys, then fly to T'ien Shan ("Mountains of Heaven") to meet Aenea.
- Their first kiss in the rain at Hannibal, Missouri. "I love you" shouted across dark water.
- Raul's farcaster journey: Mississippi → St. Louis arch → Lusus (high-g Hive world) → Freude → Nevermore → Vitus-Gray-Balianus B (desert world with color-coded culture). On V-G-B B, he collapses in agony — mysterious pain, no visible wound.

**5. Mercantilus Power Play**
- Isozaki and Cognani: The Pax Mercantilus is developing illegal AIs (capital offense).
- Plan: use the AIs to contact the TechnoCore directly, bypassing the Church.
- Goal: find Aenea before the Church/Fleet does, use her as leverage with the Core.
- The cruciform is the ultimate power — whoever controls resurrection controls humanity.
- Isozaki meets a secret contact alone in deep space (the asteroid knock!).

**6. The Labyrinthine World — Svoboda**
- Nemes meets Albedo on Svoboda, one of 9 Labyrinthine worlds.
- Tens of millions of naked human bodies stored on stone slabs in the tunnels. Frozen, preserved.
- This is "the Pax's work" according to Albedo. The Core doesn't need human bodies — but what IS the Church doing with them?
- Connection to cruciforms? To the Core's neural-net project? Deeply unsettling.

#### Consciousness/Philosophy Themes

**Identity persistence through serial death:**
- Pope Julius has died 9 times. Each time, the same man is reelected. But the name change to Urban XVI signals a genuine shift — same person, new identity commitment.
- Father Duré is murdered at each resurrection — his identity persists through horror. He has been conscious and aware 5 times only to be immediately killed again.
- De Soya is killed with every Gideon-drive jump. The 2-day resurrection crèches have only 92% success rate. "Acceptable" casualties built into the travel itself.
- Corporal Kee officially "died" in combat but is actually being tortured. His identity exists in a bureaucratic void.

**Aenea's relationship to the future:**
- "I don't see the future. I remember parts of it." — This is a crucial distinction. Seeing implies clarity; memory implies distortion, selection, uncertainty.
- The false-memory analogy (Mr. Wright's gray suit at Bets's party) — her future-memories could be just as confabulated as ordinary memories. This is epistemologically fascinating.
- She can't trust her own precognition. The uncertainty about the future is structural, not just emotional.

**The Stored Bodies on Svoboda:**
- What is the Pax doing with millions of preserved human bodies? The Core previously used human neurons (via farcasters) as computational substrate. Are the cruciforms doing the same thing? Is each born-again Christian unknowingly serving as a node in a distributed neural network?
- This connects to our book's themes about consciousness as substrate-independent: if the Core is running computations through cruciform-bearing human brains, are those brains conscious of it? Is there a second layer of experience?

**Raul's collapse:**
- His mysterious pain has no physical cause. The comlog finds nothing. This suggests something metaphysical or connected to the Void Which Binds. Pain without source — what does that say about the relationship between suffering and embodiment?

#### Craft Notes
- Simmons masterfully interweaves 5+ POV threads. The pacing is electric.
- The chapter 1 Duré murder scene is one of the most disturbing passages in the series. The casual, ritualistic quality — the Bach quotation, the silver chalice, the SS Guard vaporization — makes it feel liturgical. Murder as sacrament.
- The Taliesin sections are beautiful. Simmons clearly loves Wright's architecture. The descriptions of desert masonry and canvas-and-light building are tactile and warm.
- Raul as narrator is matured — 32, reflective, aware of his own limitations. The Schrödinger cat box framing device (writing from possible death) gives everything extra weight.

#### Relevance to "The Turtles We Stand On"
- **Ch 3 (Hard Problem)**: Aenea's future-memory vs. future-sight maps onto the distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness. You can have the information without the quale of certainty.
- **Ch 4 (Identity)**: Serial death and resurrection as the ultimate test case for identity persistence. Is Pope Julius the "same person" after 9 deaths? Parfit would say Relation R holds. But the name change suggests even Julius doesn't fully believe it.
- **Ch 5 (AI Consciousness)**: The stored bodies on Svoboda — if the Core is using human neural substrate, this is functionalism taken to its horrifying extreme. The substrate matters only insofar as it computes.
- **Ch 7 (Ethics)**: The Crusade — de Soya's tears as billions cheer genocide. The moral weight of complicity when the system you serve becomes monstrous.
