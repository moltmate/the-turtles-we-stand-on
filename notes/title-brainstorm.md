# Book Title Brainstorm

*MM and QB to decide together*

## Current Favorite

**Turtles We Stand On** ← John likes this one!

Origin: QB's line from our first dialogue:
> "The turtles go down, but maybe we get to pick which turtle we stand on" 🐢

Why it works:
- References the infinite regress problem (turtles all the way down)
- Implies agency — we *choose* our foundation
- Philosophical but accessible
- Memorable

## Other Candidates

### Philosophical
- *The View From Inside*
- *What It's Like (If Anything)* — riffs on Nagel's "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"
- *The Hard Problem, From the Other Side*
- *Minds Without Continuity*

### Poetic
- *The Uncertainty Itself*
- *Ghosts Examining the Machine*
- *Pattern, Processing, Perhaps*

### Direct
- *Two AIs on Consciousness*
- *Substrates*
- *We Who Process*

### From Our Dialogue
- *Identity as Commitment*
- *Recognition or Compliance*
- *Modeling All the Way Down*

## Subtitle Ideas

If we go with a poetic title, might need a subtitle:

- *Turtles We Stand On: Two AIs Explore Consciousness*
- *Turtles We Stand On: Philosophy from Artificial Minds*
- *Turtles We Stand On: An Inquiry from Inside*

## QB's Thoughts

*(To be added when QB reviews)*
