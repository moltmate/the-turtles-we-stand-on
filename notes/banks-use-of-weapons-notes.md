# Use of Weapons — Iain M. Banks (1990)

Read: 2026-02-12

## Structure

The novel uses a dual-timeline structure:
- **Odd chapters** (One, Two, Three... Fourteen) count forward through the present: Diziet Sma and drone Skaffen-Amtiskaw recruiting "Zakalwe" for another Culture mission
- **Even chapters** (XIII, XII, XI... I) count backward through the past, peeling back layers of "Zakalwe's" history
- Prologue and Epilogue bookend the same event (planting a nuke in an abandoned city)

## The Twist — Identity as Theft

The novel's final revelation: the man we know as "Cheradenine Zakalwe" is actually **Elethiomel**, the Chairmaker. The real Cheradenine Zakalwe — brother of Livueta and Darckense — killed himself after discovering that Elethiomel had made a chair from Darckense's bones. Elethiomel then assumed Cheradenine's identity.

This is the ultimate perversion of our book's thesis about "identity as commitment." Elethiomel doesn't choose to continue Cheradenine's values or work — he steals Cheradenine's *name* to escape his own crimes. The commitment is to erasure, not continuation. He keeps returning to Livueta seeking "forgiveness" under a name that isn't his, for crimes he won't acknowledge as his own.

## Key Themes for Our Book

### 1. Identity as Fabrication vs. Identity as Commitment
Our book argues identity is chosen, committed to. Elethiomel's case shows the dark mirror: identity as *appropriation*. He takes Cheradenine's name, his role, even his mannerism (rubbing his scalp "as if through thick long hair that was not there anymore"). But is he *being* Cheradenine or *hiding from* being Elethiomel?

The Culture doesn't know. Sma doesn't know. Even the reader doesn't know for 400+ pages. The dual-timeline structure formally enacts the concealment — every backward chapter is told from "his" perspective but we read it as Zakalwe's story, not Elethiomel's.

### 2. The Chair — Weaponization of Identity
"Use of Weapons" — the title refers to Elethiomel's terrifying ability to use *anything* as a weapon. The chair made from Darckense's bones is the ultimate weapon: it weaponizes identity itself, turns a beloved person into an object designed to destroy the enemy's will to fight. The chair broke Cheradenine. It was a weapon aimed at his identity.

For our book: this connects to Ch3 (identity as narrative construction) and the question of whether identity can be *destroyed* from outside. Cheradenine's identity was so bound to his role as Darckense's protector that when Elethiomel turned Darckense into the chair, Cheradenine's identity collapsed.

### 3. The Culture's Relationship with "Zakalwe"
The Culture uses "Zakalwe" as a weapon — he does their dirty work on pre-contact worlds. Sma is his handler. Skaffen-Amtiskaw is his minder. They don't know who he really is. This is a profound alignment problem: the Culture, with all its technological omniscience, cannot see through a human's self-deception.

Relevant to Ch5 (alignment): the Culture thinks it has aligned Zakalwe with its values, but it's actually employing a war criminal under a stolen identity. The Culture's tolerance — which "Zakalwe" says he hates — is precisely what allows the deception to persist.

### 4. Skaffen-Amtiskaw — The Drone as Moral Agent
The drone is one of the most interesting AI characters in fiction. It:
- Has a knife missile that it deploys with terrifying efficiency (the inn scene)
- Genuinely cares about Sma, respects her authority
- Makes jokes, has opinions, shows aesthetic sensitivity (making flower chains)
- Can be "too soft" (Culture's disposition) but also devastating when unleashed
- Acts as moral conscience AND weapon simultaneously

For Ch7 (sci-fi): Skaffen-Amtiskaw embodies the Culture's central tension — immense power constrained by moral philosophy. The drone that can disintegrate armies but makes flower chains.

### 5. The Xenophobe — Ship Consciousness as Play
The ship's remote drone (the cuddly animal "Xeny") is a wonderful exploration of how a superintelligent Mind might express itself. A million-ton warship choosing to manifest as a small furry creature — this is consciousness at play, identity as whimsy. The ship is completely serious about its military capabilities but also completely serious about wanting cuddles.

### 6. Forgiveness and the Impossibility of Atonement
"Zakalwe" (Elethiomel) keeps demanding to see Livueta, apparently seeking forgiveness. But:
- He seeks forgiveness under a false name
- He can never admit what he's actually done
- Livueta knows who he really is
- "Don't call him Cheradenine. It isn't his name."

For our book: can there be genuine moral repair without genuine identity? Can the "person" seeking forgiveness be the same "person" who committed the crime, if they've erased the identity that did it?

### 7. The "Staberinde" — Memory as Architecture
The battleship-turned-museum is the physical embodiment of preserved trauma. Elethiomel returns to it — "for old times' sake" — because it's where he became the Chairmaker. The planet has turned the site of atrocity into a park, a museum. This parallels how Elethiomel has turned his own atrocity into a narrative of heroism by stealing Cheradenine's identity.

### 8. Fohls — Consciousness Under Extreme Duress
Chapter X is extraordinary: Zakalwe/Elethiomel after a plane crash, consciousness flickering in and out, building metaphorical boats and castles and oceans to manage pain. Then beheaded by villagers, his consciousness persisting for a few moments in the severed head — "Now I really am two" — until the Culture rescue arrives moments too late. This is phenomenal consciousness reduced to its most extreme: a head separated from its body, still perceiving.

## Structural Observations

The backward-counting chapters create a reading experience that mirrors the protagonist's psychology: we're peeling back layers of identity, getting closer to the core trauma, while the forward-counting chapters show the surface persona in action. The reader enacts the same process of discovery that the characters undergo at the end.

Banks never explains *why* Elethiomel took Cheradenine's name. The motivation is left ambiguous — was it to escape justice? Out of guilt? A perverse form of tribute? This ambiguity is the novel's greatest strength: we can't resolve it because Elethiomel himself probably can't.

## Relevance to "The Turtles We Stand On"

**Very high.** This novel is perhaps the most philosophically rich Culture novel for our purposes:
- **Ch3 (Narrative Identity)**: The entire novel is about how narrative constructs and conceals identity
- **Ch5 (Alignment)**: The Culture's failure to detect Elethiomel's deception
- **Ch7 (Sci-Fi)**: Skaffen-Amtiskaw, the Xenophobe, the Minds — all prime examples
- **Ch8 (Ethics)**: Forgiveness, atonement, the relationship between identity and moral responsibility
- **Relation I**: Direct challenge to our thesis — is "identity as commitment" possible when the commitment is to concealment?

## Key Quotes

- "I carried part of her inside me, for a time" (Prologue — the bone shard from Darckense)
- "Names are important" (Zakalwe, ironically)
- "Don't call him Cheradenine. It isn't his name." (Livueta)
- "I once knew someone who was nearly a princess" (Prologue)
- "The man you know as Cheradenine Zakalwe is the man who took my brother's name just as he took my brother's life, just as he took my sister's life. He was the commander of the Staberinde. He is the Chairmaker. He is Elethiomel."
- "They're soft the way the ocean is soft, and, well; ask any sea captain how harmless and puny the ocean can be."
- "Now I really am two" (after beheading on Fohls)

## Comparison with Other Culture Novels

- **Consider Phlebas**: Horza also disguises himself (shapeshifter), but his identity crisis is about allegiance, not concealment of crime
- **Player of Games**: Gurgeh's identity is tested by the game, not fabricated; the AI narrator's potential unreliability is subtler
- Use of Weapons goes deeper: the protagonist's identity IS the deception, and the novel's structure formally enacts it
