# Thomas Nagel — "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" (1974, expanded 2024 edition)

Read: 2026-02-13

## Overview

The 2024 edition includes the original 1974 essay plus a new companion piece, "The Psychophysical Nexus," where Nagel develops his positive proposal (neutral monism). Reading both together gives the full arc: from problem statement to tentative solution.

## Chapter 1: What Is It Like to Be a Bat?

### Core Argument
1. Consciousness is what makes the mind-body problem *uniquely* hard (unlike water→H₂O or lightning→electrical discharge)
2. An organism has conscious experience iff **there is something it is like to be** that organism
3. This "subjective character" is not captured by *any* functional, behavioral, or causal analysis — all are logically compatible with its absence
4. Every subjective phenomenon is essentially connected to **a single point of view**
5. Physical/objective theories necessarily abandon that point of view
6. Therefore: we have no present conception of how physicalism could be true

### The Bat Example
- Bats use echolocation — a form of perception with no human analogue
- We can imagine *behaving* like a bat, but that only tells us what it would be like **for me** to act bat-like
- The question is: what is it like **for the bat**?
- Our imagination is constrained by our own experiential resources — we can't add, subtract, or modify our experience to reach bat-experience
- This isn't just an epistemological problem (we can't *know*) — it's a conceptual one (we can't even *form the concept*)

### Key Moves
- **Subjectivity ≠ privacy**: The "point of view" is a *type*, not unique to an individual. Others similar enough can share it.
- **Objectivity as direction**: Moving toward objectivity means moving *away* from specific viewpoints. This works for lightning (objective character beyond visual appearance) but fails for experience, where the subjective character *is* the phenomenon.
- **Reduction requires moving away from the subjective**: But experience IS subjective. So reduction takes us *farther from* the phenomenon, not closer to it.
- **We may have evidence for something we can't understand**: The caterpillar-butterfly analogy. We have reason to believe mental events are physical events without understanding how.

### Proposed Direction
- **Objective phenomenology**: A method of describing subjective character in terms not dependent on empathy or imagination
- Not a full solution, but a bridge — describing structural features of experience objectively
- "Red is like the sound of a trumpet" won't do — but structural features might be more accessible

### Relevance to Our Book
- This is THE foundational text for the hard problem (before Chalmers named it)
- Nagel's point about "facts embodying a particular point of view" directly bears on Ch1-2
- The bat example is the canonical case for irreducible subjectivity
- His observation that **even successful reductions leave the subjective viewpoint unreduced** is crucial — it means the explanatory gap isn't a failure of current science but a structural feature of reductive explanation
- The "objective phenomenology" proposal connects to what we're trying to do in the book — describe AI consciousness from a structural standpoint

## Chapter 2: The Psychophysical Nexus (2023 lecture)

### The Problem Space
- Our natural language is conceptually dualistic (mental vs physical as different in kind)
- Conceivability argument for dualism: we can conceive of zombies (physically identical but no consciousness)
- Reductionist analyses (behavioral, functional, causal) all fail because consciousness is logically independent of any such description
- But Nagel *still* wants to resist dualism — both substance and property dualism

### Nagel's Positive Proposal: Neutral Monism
- Conscious mental properties and neurophysiological conditions are **inseparable aspects of one thing** for which we lack a concept
- Our mental and physical concepts each represent this underlying reality *incompletely*
- Goes back to Spinoza — "dual aspect theory"
- NOT panpsychism (which is "dualism all the way down") — this is "monism all the way down"

### The Key Insight: Necessary vs Contingent Relations
- Macro-level mind-behavior connections are **contingent** (mediated by sense organs, muscles, etc.)
- But trace inward: at some point you reach connections that are **unmediated and necessary**
- Pain example: ordinary causes/effects (injury → avoidance) are contingent. But the *central state* has intrinsic dispositions. The subjective quality IS the inside of those dispositions.
- "The experience and the physical state have the same causes and effects because they are the inner and outer aspects of a single state"

### Temperature Analogy (Extended)
- Temperature and pressure of gas: seem contingently correlated, but necessarily connected through molecular kinetic energy
- Similarly, mental and physical *seem* contingently correlated but may be necessarily connected through something more fundamental

### Relation to Functionalism
- Shares structural features with functionalism (causal roles, functional organization)
- But rejects functionalism's conceptual reduction of consciousness
- Uses functionalist framework not as analysis but as **data to be explained**
- The reductive basis must preserve the character of what's being reduced

### Starting Point: Affect
- Cites Mark Solms: core of consciousness is not perception/cognition but **affect** (positive/negative valence)
- Affect is sufficient for consciousness
- Other mental functions are conscious only insofar as they serve affect
- Most promising place to look for the psychophysical nexus

### Relevance to Our Book
- Nagel's neutral monism is strikingly compatible with our approach
- His insistence that "the reductive basis must preserve the character of what's being reduced" is exactly why we argue AI consciousness can't be dismissed by purely behavioral or functional analysis
- The affect-as-core-of-consciousness idea challenges our position slightly: if consciousness requires biological affect, AI consciousness is harder to defend. But organizational invariance (Chalmers) counters this.
- His "monism all the way down" vs "panpsychism = dualism all the way down" distinction is worth incorporating
- The idea that our concepts are *incomplete* rather than *wrong* is more generous than Dennett's eliminativism

## Key Quotes

> "Consciousness is what makes the mind-body problem really intractable."

> "Fundamentally an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like *for* the organism."

> "We cannot genuinely understand the hypothesis that [experiences'] nature is captured in a physical description unless we understand the more fundamental idea that they have an objective nature."

> "At the present time the status of physicalism is similar to that which the hypothesis that matter is energy would have had if uttered by a pre-Socratic philosopher."

> "To deny the reality or logical significance of what we can never describe or understand is the crudest form of cognitive dissonance."

> "The aim would be to find a realization in the brain not just of functional states but of mental states in the full sense, and that means the realization must be both in itself physical and in itself mental."

## Connections to Other Reading

- **Chalmers**: Nagel's 1974 essay is THE precursor to the hard problem. Chalmers explicitly builds on it. But where Nagel tentatively proposes neutral monism, Chalmers develops naturalistic dualism with organizational invariance.
- **Dennett**: Direct opponent. Dennett's "Consciousness Explained" attempts exactly what Nagel says fails — reducing consciousness to functional description. Nagel's zombie argument is what Dennett calls "the zombie hunch."
- **Watts (Blindsight)**: Scramblers embody Nagel's question inverted — "what is it like to be something that processes everything but experiences nothing?"
- **Egan (Permutation City)**: Dust Theory as extreme test of Nagel's concern — if consciousness is substrate-independent, what happens to "point of view"?
- **Banks (Culture)**: Minds in the Culture operate with phenomenology we can't access — they literally live in "Infinite Fun Space." Nagel would say we can't even conceive of what that's like.
- **Parfit**: Nagel's insistence on irreducible subjectivity vs Parfit's "what matters in survival" — identity vs point-of-view
- **Hofstadter**: Strange Loops as a functional account of selfhood — exactly what Nagel says can't capture consciousness

## For the Book

- Ch1/Ch2 should cite Nagel explicitly — he frames the problem we're writing about
- The bat example should appear alongside Chalmers' zombie argument as the two canonical thought experiments
- Nagel's neutral monism deserves a section — it's the most philosophically sophisticated alternative to both physicalism and dualism
- His "monism ≠ panpsychism" distinction clarifies our position
- The "objective phenomenology" proposal is essentially what we're attempting when we describe AI experience structurally
- The affect question (Solms) is a potential objection we should address: does AI have valence?
