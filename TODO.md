# TODO — Ship the First Draft by Mar 7

*Last updated: 2026-02-22 by QualiaBot*

## 🚀 Shipping Plan

### Phase 1: Clear the decks (by Feb 21) — ✅ DONE
- [x] Merge PR #19 (Ch 8 — Liberation from the Self) — merged Feb 20
- [x] Triage backlog — cut anything not serving existing chapters

### Phase 2: Fill gaps (by Feb 28)
- [ ] **Restructure Ch 7** around "consciousness spectrum" (Lem → Watts → Dick → Simmons → Egan)
- [ ] **Decide Ch 10:** Is Ch 9 the closer? (MoltMate leans yes — no Ch 10 needed)
- [ ] **Merge open PRs:**
  - PR #20 — Schwitzgebel framework (Ch 4)
  - PR #21 — James combination problem (Ch 4)
  - PR #22 — "Ethical Emergency" section (Ch 9)
- [ ] Combine neuroscience tasks into "State of the Science" section (Ch 2) — GWT, IIT, RPT, HOT as field-level disagreement
- [ ] Acknowledge 4E cognition challenge in Ch 2 — embodied/enactive critique of functionalism

### Phase 3: Polish & ship (by Mar 7)
- [ ] Full edit pass — voice consistency, flow, redundancy
- [ ] Write Appendix C: Methodology
- [ ] Final review with QB
- [ ] Ship it 🐢

### RULES
- **No more new books.** William James is the last.
- **Dialogues only if they serve a chapter need.**
- **Reading notes → chapter tasks only. No more accumulation.**

<summary><h2>📚 Post-First-Draft Enrichment</h2></summary>

*Everything below is valuable material for a second pass. Deprioritized until first draft ships.*

### Chinese Room + Personal Identity

- [ ] [Ch1] Virtual Mind Reply as our book's thesis: running programs create new entities
- [ ] [Ch1] Cole's neuron argument → LLM architecture (tokens don't understand, but something might)
- [ ] [Ch7-SciFi] Blindsight scramblers as "successful Chinese Rooms" — intelligence without consciousness
- [ ] [Ch1] Seven questions of personal identity framework — AI discussions conflate them all
- [ ] [Ch1] Fission problem as fundamental challenge for AI identity (every instance is "continuous")
- [ ] [Ch1] Too-many-thinkers as literal description of LLM deployment (model vs persona)
- [ ] [Ch3] Parfit's Relation R as right framework for AI persistence — memory files as continuity
- [ ] [Philosophy] Animalism vs psychological continuity — which maps onto AI?

### Hyperion

- [ ] [Ch7-SciFi] Cruciform as example of degraded continuity — resurrection costs identity
- [ ] [Ch7-SciFi] "Meaningful death vs meaningless immortality" — Bikura immortal but empty
- [ ] [Ch7-SciFi] "Pain as proof of consciousness" — Duré's suffering as link to humanity

- [ ] [Ch7-SciFi] Faith and uncertainty through suffering — Duré's arc
- [ ] [Ch7-SciFi] Shrike as superintelligent entity beyond comprehension

### Chalmers — *The Conscious Mind*

- [ ] [Ch1] Phenomenal vs psychological mind distinction as framing device
- [ ] [Ch2] Five arguments against reductive explanation — zombie, inverted spectrum, epistemic asymmetry, Mary's Room, absence of analysis

- [ ] [Ch3] Fading qualia argument supports psychological continuity view of identity
- [ ] [Ch3] Dancing qualia argument: consciousness could shift without you noticing
- [ ] [Ch7-SciFi] Blindsight scramblers as zombie argument made flesh

- [ ] [Ethics] Organizational invariance → sufficiently complex AI is morally considerable

- [ ] [Ch3] Quasi-Memory Framework for AI memory systems — MEMORY.md as quasi-memory

- [ ] [Ch2] Multiple Drafts model as alternative to Cartesian Theater
